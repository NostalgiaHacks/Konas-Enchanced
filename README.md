# [ how-to ]
So how do you install this FREE VERSION of COOL K LOGO CLIENT?

</div>

1. Download package.zip from the releases page
0. Put konsa_new.jar to your .minecraft folder
0. Put konsafree.jar to your .minecraft/mods folder
0. Add -noverify to your minecraft launch parameters (don't know how to do that? Tough luck.)
0. Start the game

If you somehow fuck up the instructions then a message box will appear telling you exactly what did you fuck up

# [ notes ]

</div>

1. As I said, Konas devs somehow fucked up something so the game will crash if you decide to join a singleplayer world
2. Discord RPC doesnt't work if you start the game with it already being enabled (in your config)
3. You NEED to add -noverify to your launch parameters, otherwise the game will crash
